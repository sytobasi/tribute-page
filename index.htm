            <strong><a>Steve Jobs</a></strong><br />
           What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short i've written
                as an adult(and certainly Every one that has been published),
                almost every email i've ever written, has been 
                written on machines created by Apple
                 I interacted using an Apple machine long
                  before i ever encountered a PC.
                Steve Jobs helped to realise the Star Trek future I
                 dreamed of as a kid. And through his vision, 
                 I have been able to
                 realize my own. You'll be missed
                Mr Jobs thanks for all your amazing works.

            A part of my heart has cracked. i didn't know him personally but i felt like I 
                knew him. i will forever remember him. I'm still saddened because 
                he was taken soon. I can only imagin his struggles. 
                Heaven has certainly gained an angel.

                I will dearly miss Steve Jobs he inspired me to keep getting the 
                iphones.I have loved them ever since the first one. Steve Jobs was a 
                great man and a awesome CEO for Apple. He has inspired me to one day
                and go for and work with the Appple when i get old but my dream to own
                Apple and follow by Steve Jobs he's a great man and i will never forget him.

             Dear Steve's family, dear Apple company i can't find words to describe
             my feelings. For me Apple means a lot-I got a good job using Apple products
             I have found  new lifestyle thanks to Apple and of course I've been always 
             admiring your products, and for me everything in apple is connected with Steve
             I do hope he'll be remembered around the world as a genius.
